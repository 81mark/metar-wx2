## Metar WX Version 2

This Project was a quick project made in React for geting the Metar and Taf reports for Airports based on their ICAO identifier. Useful for aviation weather planning.<br /><br />

Example:<br />
KSFO: San Francisco airport<br />
KJFK: JFK airport<br />
EGLL: London Heathrow airport<br />
